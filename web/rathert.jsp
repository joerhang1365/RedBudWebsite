        <h1>Rathert's Clothing Store</h1>
        <p>
            Rathert's Clothing Store is located on 124 Main Street. The Store 
            has been owned for three generations.
            Charles Rathert started the business in 1887. Whenever he passed
            away, the store went to his son, Herman, who then gave the 
            business to his son, Donald.

        <h2>Donald Rathert</h2>
        <p>
            Donald Rathert started working at Rathert's Clothing Store after
            he graduated from High School in 1949. At that time, the store
            partnered with Levi's to sell jeans. Rathert's was very profitable
            and averaged $80,000 dollars a year. However, in 1996, Levi Strauss
            & Company sent Donald Rathert a letter stating that they will no
            longer do business with his store. Levi's said that the store was
            not was not up to snuff for their brand. The store had the same 
            wallpaper from the 1900s, exposed wires, and improper
            displays. The locals were angry upon hearing this and decided to
            strike against Levi's. People from all over came to Red Bud to
            purchase jeans from Rathert's Clothing Store and news companies
            documented the event. The situation was even featured on KMOX talk
            Radio in St. Louis.

            Quote from Donald Rather: "Mr. Powers (Levi's associate) did his job.
            I was disappointed and surprised as he felt the store looked pretty
            good. The average man on the street and farmers are my customers. If
            my supply is discontinued, my business will have to close because
            ninety percent of my product is Levi's. I attribute the success of
            my sales to the way the jeans fit and the price."

        <h2>Modern Day</h2>

            in still stands. The current businesses at that location is Weis
