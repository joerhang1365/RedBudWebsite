        <h1>Opera House</h1>
        <p>
            The Opera house used to be formally known as the <b>Cowell Building</b>.
            Mr. Voges purchased the building from the Cowell family which
            was practically in ruins. Mr. Voges had an idea to restore it to its
            original glory, and initiated an inspection of the building. After it
            was concurred the building was safe, Mr. Voges began his work. While
            fixing the building, he discovered many mystery's about the Opera
            House and deemed it "the most interesting buildings in Red Bud." He
            said the open corner of the building used to be a drive through for
            a gas station, and is now an open air seating are. The second floor
            had been offices spaces. The third floor housed the Chester Knitting
            Mills in the 1920s. Because of the factory and elevator is installed
            and still worked. The top was an opera house, dance hall, and had a
            basketball court.

            The first challenge with restoring the building was it was found that
            the building was bulging, which means the sides were extruding outwards
            and reinforcements would have to be built. The second challenge was
            the roof was in poor condition and water damage laid on every floor.
