        <h1 id="heading">History of Red Bud's Buildings & Businesses</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="info">
            It has been 200 years since Preston Brickey created the first ever 
            building in Red Bud in 1820. From then to present day, Red Bud 
            has accumulated a lot of history. While scouring for information 
            regarding Red Bud's past, I came across a book at our local library
            written by Jane C. Lucht titled <i>History of Red Bud and Horse Prairie</i>.
            This book is around 200 pages long and details much of Red Bud's early
            beginnings to 2009. Jane C. Lucht also founded the cities
            museum that preserves history of early settlers.
            <br></br>
            Back in the 1860s Red Bud had a plethora of businesses. People in 
            that time period could not purchase goods from neighboring cities or
            have products shipped to them. So, Red Bud had to have shops and 
            businesses that satisfied everyone's needs. This created new stores 
            and new buildings which in turn, made Red Bud grow rapidly in the
            1900s.
            <br></br> 
            Sadly, as time goes on, communities rely less on local businesses
            for goods because of supermarkets and online shopping. Many shops
            go out of business and thus, a decrease of variety for shops in Red 
            Bud today. In this website, I hope to detail a few of Red Bud's 
            historical buildings, businesses and what they look like modern day.
