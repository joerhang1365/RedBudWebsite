        <h1>The Ziebold Building</h1>
        <p>
            The Ziebold Building was erected in 1895 by Gottlieb Ziebold. Since
            its construction, the Ziebold Building has been owned by a multitude
            of people. The building was first sold to George W. Ziebold who then
            sold it to G. Arthur Ziebold (his grandson) and is now owned by Ken
            Voges since 1996.
            <br></br> 
            The floor served as offices and housing for Red Bud residants. Judge
            Alfred Riess had an office in this building.

        <h2>North County News</h2>
        <p>
            The North County News used to be located in the Ziebold Building.
            There were two other news papers in Red Bud before North County
            News. In 1868, <i>The Egyptian</i> was the first local news paper
            and later in 1872, Albert L. Krepps stated a paper called
            <i>The Courier</i>. The North County News was created on March 26,
            1959 by Olin Kettlekamp. The news paper has had many different
            locations. In 1959 it was on 204 South Main. In 1976, it was moved
            to 26 South Main, then a year later to 124 South Main. Up until
            1989 the news paper was hand written, but that year a macintosh
            computer was purchase to compose and print the paper.
