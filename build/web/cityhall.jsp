        <h1>The City Hall</h1>
        <p>
            The Red Bud City Hall was constructed in 1894. Finding the contractor 
            who built the City Hall is a bit of a chase. The first contractor to
            design the building was Louis Hormann. Hormann wanted to charge the 
            city $160 to make the design for the building. The council, I guess, 
            were stingy and dropped Hormann from the project to hire a different
            contractor for $50. However, the inexpensive contractor created a 
            design that cost $10,745 and the council was not satisfied 
            paying that price. So, they again decided to hire Louis Hormann, this 
            time for $250, and told him to make a brilliant building with a 
            budget of $8,000. Louis succeeded in making the towns City Hall for
            $7,800.
            <br></br>
            This building was regarded as the best in the area and the City 
            Council has operated in this building since the day of its
            construction without exception.

        <h2>Clock and Bell</h2>
        <p>
            The bell and clock inside the City Hall are treasures. The Bell was purchased
            from Sparta for $350 and the weighed a total of 500 pounds. A
            memorable event with the City Hall's bell was in 1943. The 2000
            pound weights pulling the mechanism to ring the bell broke that year
            and created a perpetual ringing of the City Hall's bell. This happened
            late at night and all the residents were confused as to what was going on.
            The bell was later fixed and no other problems occurred with the building.
            The Clock in the City Hall was hand wound.

        <h2>Renovations</h2>
        <p>
            Since its construction, the building has had multiple 
            renovations. In 1997, the front of the building received a major 
            overhaul and in 2005 the first and second floors were remodeled.
